## Navigating the Service Mesh Landscape

Thursday 12th December -  16.15

Service meshes offer a number of capabilities around security, traffic management and observability. They provide a compelling approach to shift the requirements related to these capabilities out of our code bases.

Istio, Linkerd and Consul are all really capable options within this space. But how do you decide between them?

What scenarios are each of them best suited for? Which one best delivers the capabilities both your business and workloads require? And what are the overheads and implications of running them within your environment?

In this talk, Paul will help you make sense of this landscape and leave you with the tools to make the decision that is best for you.
